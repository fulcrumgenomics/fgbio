# CallDuplexConsensusReads

## Overview
**Group:** Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs)

Calls duplex consensus sequences from reads generated from the same _double-stranded_ source molecule. Prior
to running this tool, read must have been grouped with `GroupReadsByUmi` using the `paired` strategy. Doing
so will apply (by default) MI tags to all reads of the form `*/A` and `*/B` where the /A and /B suffixes
with the same identifier denote reads that are derived from opposite strands of the same source duplex molecule.

Reads from the same unique molecule are first partitioned by source strand and assembled into single
strand consensus molecules as described by CallMolecularConsensusReads.  Subsequently, for molecules that
have at least one observation of each strand, duplex consensus reads are assembled by combining the evidence
from the two single strand consensus reads.

Because of the nature of duplex sequencing, this tool does not support fragment reads - if found in the
input they are _ignored_.  Similarly, read pairs for which consensus reads cannot be generated for one or
other read (R1 or R2) are omitted from the output.

Consensus reads have a number of additional optional tags set in the resulting BAM file.  The tag names follow
a pattern where the first letter (a, b or c) denotes that the tag applies to the first single strand consensus (a),
second single-strand consensus (b) or the final duplex consensus (c).  The second letter is intended to capture
the meaning of the tag (e.g. d=depth, m=min depth, e=errors/error-rate) and is upper case for values that are
one per read and lower case for values that are one per base.

The tags break down into those that are single-valued per read:

```
consensus depth      [aD,bD,cD] (int)  : the maximum depth of raw reads at any point in the consensus reads
consensus min depth  [aM,bM,cM] (int)  : the minimum depth of raw reads at any point in the consensus reads
consensus error rate [aE,bE,cE] (float): the fraction of bases in raw reads disagreeing with the final consensus calls
```

And those that have a value per base (duplex values are not generated, but can be generated by summing):

```
consensus depth  [ad,bd] (short[]): the count of bases contributing to each single-strand consensus read at each position
consensus errors [ae,be] (short[]): the count of bases from raw reads disagreeing with the final single-strand consensus base
consensus errors [ac,bc] (string): the single-strand consensus bases
consensus errors [aq,bq] (string): the single-strand consensus qualities
```

The per base depths and errors are both capped at 32,767. In all cases no-calls (Ns) and bases below the
min-input-base-quality are not counted in tag value calculations.

The --min-reads option can take 1-3 values similar to `FilterConsensusReads`. For example:

```
CallDuplexConsensusReads ... --min-reads 10 5 3
```

If fewer than three values are supplied, the last value is repeated (i.e. `5 4` -> `5 4 4` and `1` -> `1 1 1`.  The
first value applies to the final consensus read, the second value to one single-strand consensus, and the last
value to the other single-strand consensus. It is required that if values two and three differ,
the _more stringent value comes earlier_.
