For the most prevalent                                               barcode this will be 1, for all others it will be less than 1 (except                                               for the possible exception of when there are more unmatched templates                                               than for any other barcode, in which case the value may be arbitrarily                                               large).  One over the lowest number in this column gives you the                                               fold-difference in representation between barcodes.|

|pf_normalized_matches|Proportion|The "normalized" matches to each barcode.

If all barcodes are                              represented equally this will be                              1.|

### DuplexUmiMetric

Metrics produced by `CollectDuplexSeqMetrics` describing the set of observed duplex UMI sequences and the
frequency of their observations.  The UMI sequences reported may have been corrected using information
within a double-stranded tag family.  For example if a tag family is comprised of three read pairs with
UMIs `ACGT-TGGT`, `ACGT-TGGT`, and `ACGT-TGGG` then a consensus UMI of `ACGT-TGGT` will be generated.UMI pairs are normalized within a tag family so that observations are always reported as if they came
from a read pair with read 1 on the positive strand (F1R2). Another way to view this is that for FR or RF
read pairs, the duplex UMI reported is the UMI from the positive strand read followed by the UMI from the
negative strand read.  E.g. a read pair with UMI `AAAA-GGGG` and with R1 on the negative strand and R2 on
the positive strand, will be reported as `GGGG-AAAA`.


|Column|Type|Description|
|------|----|-----------|
|umi|String|The duplex UMI sequence, possibly-corrected.|

|unique_observations|Count|The number of double-stranded tag families (i.e unique double-stranded molecules)                            that observed the duplex UMI.|
|fraction_raw_observations|Proportion|The fraction of all raw observations that the duplex UMI accounts for.|
|fraction_unique_observations|Proportion|The fraction of all unique observations that the duplex UMI accounts for.|
|fraction_unique_observations_expected|Proportion|The fraction of all unique observations that are expected to be                                              attributed to the duplex UMI based on the `fraction_unique_observations`                                              of the two individual UMIs.|


### UmiMetric

Metrics produced by `CollectDuplexSeqMetrics` describing the set of observed UMI sequences and the
frequency of their observations.  The UMI sequences reported may have been corrected using information
within a double-stranded tag family.  For example if a tag family is comprised of three read pairs with
UMIs `ACGT-TGGT`, `ACGT-TGGT`, and `ACGT-TGGG` then a consensus UMI of `ACGT-TGGT` will be generated,
and three raw observations counted for each of `ACGT` and `TGGT`, and no observations counted for `TGGG`.

|umi|String|The UMI sequence, possibly-corrected.|

|fraction_unique_observations|Proportion|The fraction of all unique observations that the UMI accounts for.|


### DuplexYieldMetric

Metrics produced by `CollectDuplexSeqMetrics` that are sampled at various levels of coverage, via random
downsampling, during the construction of duplex metrics.  The downsampling is done in such a way that the
`fraction`s are approximate, and not exact, therefore the `fraction` field should only be interpreted as a guide
and the `read_pairs` field used to quantify how much data was used.See `FamilySizeMetric` for detailed definitions of `CS`, `SS` and `DS` as used below.


|Column|Type|Description|
|------|----|-----------|
|fraction|Proportion|The approximate fraction of the full dataset that was used to generate the remaining values.|
|read_pairs|Count|The number of read pairs upon which the remaining metrics are based.|
|cs_families|Count|The number of _CS_ (Coordinate & Strand) families present in the data.|
|ss_families|Count|The number of _SS_ (Single-Strand by UMI) families present in the data.|

### DuplexFamilySizeMetric

Metrics produced by `CollectDuplexSeqMetrics` to describe the distribution of double-stranded (duplex)
tag families in terms of the number of reads observed on each strand.We refer to the two strands as `ab` and `ba` because we identify the two strands by observing the same pair of
UMIs (A and B) in opposite order (A->B vs B->A). Which strand is `ab` and which is `ba` is largely arbitrary, so
to make interpretation of the metrics simpler we use a definition here that for a given tag family
`ab` is the sub-family with more reads and `ba` is the tag family with fewer reads.


|Column|Type|Description|
|------|----|-----------|
|ab_size|Int|The number of reads in the `ab` sub-family (the larger sub-family) for this double-strand tag family.|
|ba_size|Int|The number of reads in the `ba` sub-family (the smaller sub-family) for this double-strand tag family.|
|count|Count|The number of families with the `ab` and `ba` single-strand families of size `ab_size` and `ba_size`.|
|fraction|Proportion|The fraction of all double-stranded tag families that have `ab_size` and `ba_size`.|
|fraction_gt_or_eq_size|Proportion|The fraction of all double-stranded tag families that have                               `ab reads >= ab_size` and `ba reads >= ba_size`.|


### FamilySizeMetric

Metrics produced by `CollectDuplexSeqMetrics` to quantify the distribution of different kinds of read family
sizes.  Three kinds of families are described:1. _CS_ or _Coordinate & Strand_: families of reads that are grouped together by their unclipped 5'
   genomic positions and strands just as they are in traditional PCR duplicate marking
2. _SS_ or _Single Strand_: single-strand families that are each subsets of a CS family create by
   also using the UMIs to partition the larger family, but not linking up families that are
   created from opposing strands of the same source molecule.
3. _DS_ or _Double Strand_: families that are created by combining single-strand families that are from
   opposite strands of the same source molecule. This does **not** imply that all DS families are composed
   of reads from both strands; where only one strand of a source molecule is observed a DS family is
   still counted.

|family_size|Int|The family size, i.e. the number of read pairs grouped together into a family.|

|ds_fraction|Proportion|The fraction of all _DS_ families where `size == family_size`.|
|ds_fraction_gt_or_eq_size|Proportion|The fraction of all _DS_ families where `size >= family_size`.|


### InsertSizeMetric

Metrics produced by `EstimateRnaSeqInsertSize` to describe the distribution of insert sizes within an
RNA-seq experiment.  The insert sizes are computed in "transcript space", accounting for spliced

mixture that is attributable to a specific sample with a known set of genotypes.


|Column|Type|Description|
|------|----|-----------|
|sample|String|The name of the sample within the pool being reported on.|
|variant_sites|Count|How many sites were examined at which the reported sample is known to be variant.|
|singletons|Count|How many of the variant sites were sites at which only this sample was variant.|
|estimated_fraction|Proportion|The estimated fraction of the pool that comes from this sample.|
|standard_error|Double|The standard error of the estimated fraction.|
|ci99_low|Proportion|The lower bound of the 99% confidence interval for the estimated fraction.|
|ci99_high|Proportion|The upper bound of the 99% confidence interval for the estimated fraction.|


### SwitchMetric

Summary metrics regarding switchback reads found.


|Column|Type|Description|
|------|----|-----------|
|sample|String|The name of the sample sequenced.|
|library|String|The name of the library sequenced.|
|templates|Count|The total number of templates (i.e. inserts, unique read names) seen in the input.|
|aligned_templates|Count|The number of templates that had at least one aligned read.|
|switchback_templates|Count|The number of templates identified as having a switchback event.|
|fraction_switchbacks|Proportion|The fraction of all templates that appear to have switchbacks in them.|
|read_based_switchbacks|Count|The count of switchback_templates that were identified by looking for soft-clipped                               reverse complementary sequence at the ends of reads.|
|mean_length|Double|The mean length of the reverse complementary sequence in the `read_based_switchbacks`.|
|mean_offset|Double|The mean offset of the `read_based_switchbacks`.|
|tandem_based_switchbacks|Count|The count of switchback_templates that were identified because they had paired                                 reads mapped in FF or RR orientations within the designated gap size range.|
|mean_gap|Double|The mean gap size for `tandem_based_switchbacks`|


### ErrorRateByReadPositionMetric

Metrics produced by `ErrorRateByReadPosition` describing the number of base observations and
substitution errors at each position within each sequencing read.  Error rates are given for
the overall substitution error rate and also for each kind of substitution separately. Instead
of reporting 12 substitution rates, 6 are reported where complementary substitutions are grouped
together, e.g. `T>G` substitutions are reported as `A>C`.


|Column|Type|Description|
|------|----|-----------|
|read_number|Int|The read number (0 for fragments, 1 for first of pair, 2 for second of pair).|
|position|Int|The position or cycle within the read (1-based).|
|bases_total|Count|The total number of bases observed at this position.|
|errors|Count|The total number of errors or non-reference basecalls observed at this position.|
|error_rate|Double|The overall error rate at position.|
|a_to_c_error_rate|Double|The rate of `A>C` (and `T>G`) errors at the position.|
|a_to_g_error_rate|Double|The rate of `A>G` (and `T>C`) errors at the position.|
|a_to_t_error_rate|Double|The rate of `A>T` (and `T>A`) errors at the position.|
|c_to_a_error_rate|Double|The rate of `C>A` (and `G>T`) errors at the position.|
|c_to_g_error_rate|Double|The rate of `C>G` (and `G>C`) errors at the position.|
|c_to_t_error_rate|Double|The rate of `C>T` (and `G>A`) errors at the position.|


### ClippingMetrics

Metrics produced by ClipBam that detail how many reads and bases are clipped respectively.


|Column|Type|Description|
|------|----|-----------|
|read_type|ReadType|The type of read (i.e. Fragment, ReadOne, ReadTwo).|
|reads|Long|The number of reads examined.|
|reads_unmapped|Long|The number of reads that became unmapped due to clipping.|
|reads_clipped_pre|Long|The number of reads with any type of clipping prior to clipping with ClipBam.|
|reads_clipped_post|Long|The number of reads with any type of clipping after clipping with ClipBam, including reads that became unmapped.|
|reads_clipped_five_prime|Long|The number of reads with the 5' end clipped.|
|reads_clipped_three_prime|Long|The number of reads with the 3' end clipped.|
|reads_clipped_overlapping|Long|The number of reads clipped due to overlapping reads.|
|bases|Long|The number of aligned bases after clipping.|
|bases_clipped_pre|Long|The number of bases clipped prior to clipping with ClipBam.|
|bases_clipped_post|Long|The number of bases clipped after clipping with ClipBam, including bases from reads that became unmapped.|
|bases_clipped_five_prime|Long|The number of bases clipped on the 5' end of the read.|
|bases_clipped_three_prime|Long|The number of bases clipped on the 3 end of the read.|
|bases_clipped_overlapping|Long|The number of bases clipped due to overlapping reads.|
