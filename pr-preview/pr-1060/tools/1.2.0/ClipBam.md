# ClipBam

## Overview
**Group:** SAM/BAM

Clips reads from the same template. Ensures that at least N bases are clipped from any end of the read (i.e.
R1 5' end, R1 3' end, R2 5' end, and R2 3' end).  Optionally clips reads from the same template to eliminate overlap
between the reads.  This ensures that downstream processes, particularly variant calling, cannot double-count
evidence from the same template when both reads span a variant site in the same template.

Clipping overlapping reads is only performed on `FR` read pairs, and is implemented by clipping approximately half
the overlapping bases from each read.  By default hard clipping is performed; soft-clipping may be substituted
using the `--soft-clip` parameter.

Secondary alignments and supplemental alignments are not clipped, but are passed through into the
output.

If the input BAM is neither `queryname` sorted nor `query` grouped, it will be sorted into queryname
order so that clipping can be performed on both ends of a pair simultaneously and so that mate
pair information can be reset across all reads for the template.  Post-clipping the reads are
resorted into coordinate order, any existing `NM`, `UQ` and `MD` tags are repaired, and the output is
written in coordinate order.

Three clipping modes are supported:
1. `Soft` - soft-clip the bases and qualities.
2. `SoftWithMask` - soft-clip and mask the bases and qualities (make bases Ns and qualities the minimum).
3. `Hard` - hard-clip the bases and qualities.

The `--upgrade-clipping` parameter will convert all existing clipping in the input to the given more stringent mode:
from `Soft` to either `SoftWithMask` or `Hard`, and `SoftWithMask` to `Hard`. In all other cases, clipping remains
the same prior to applying any other clipping criteria.
