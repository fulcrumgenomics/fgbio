  """
    |Sorts a SAM or BAM file.  Several sort orders are available:
    |
    |1. **Coordinate**: sorts reads by their reference sequence and left-most aligned coordinate
    |2. **Queryname**: sort the reads by their query (i.e. read) name
    |3. **Random**: sorts the reads into a random order. The output is deterministic for any given input.
    |and several
    |4. **RandomQuery**: sorts the reads into a random order but keeps reads with the same
    |   queryname together. The ordering is deterministic for any given input.
    |
    |Uses a temporary directory to buffer sets of sorted reads to disk. The number of reads kept in memory
    |affects memory use and can be changed with the `--max-records-in-ram` option.  The temporary directory
    |to use can be set with the fgbio global option `--tmp-dir`.
    |
    |An example invocation might look like:
    |
    |```bash
    |java -Xmx4g -jar fgbio.jar --tmp-dir=/my/big/scratch/volume \
    |  SortBam --input=queryname.bam --sort-order=Coordinate --output coordinate.bam
    |```
